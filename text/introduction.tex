	The goal of this report is to explore some of the various techniques used for digital signal processing. 
This effort utilizes an HPGe detector to explore these techniques through the lens of gamma-ray spectroscopy. 
A trapezoidal shaping filter is implemented and optimized inorder to achieve a final calibrated energy spectrum. 
Through this the effect of ballistic deficit and various contributions to electronic noise are studied to learn about the performance of digital signal processing.
