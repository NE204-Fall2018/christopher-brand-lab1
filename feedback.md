# Overall (77/100)
 - A final runthrough for grammar and spelling is strongly recommended before
   submitting

# Build (10/10)
 - Excellent README
 - Even though the user is not expected to run the analysis to build the 
   report, still want to keep the .pdf out of the repo

# Testing (10/10)

# Introduction / Motivation / Background (15/15)
 - About as concise as can be while conveying necessary information
 - Could beef up the motivation for the work

# Methods (12/15)
 - Missing some necessary detail
 - What ranges for the parameters are considered and why
 - Motivations/advantages & disadvantages of various experimental procedures
   either incorrectly or inadequately specified

# Results and Discussion (20/40)
 - Inadequate discussion of gap-time optimization procedure
 - Hone-in on the relevant portion of the signals (i.e. the rises in the 
   preamplifier signals. You included the plots as requested, but they don't
   convey the interesting information
 - You don't mention which parameters were used for the m and k optimizations.
   For example, what value of k was used for the m-determination procedure?
 - What about the exponential deconv. param. M - no mention of how it was 
   determined or what value was used
 - Not very strong coupling between discussion and the results. A lot of what
   is included in the discussion section (BD discussion, for example) more 
   appropriately fits in the intro/theory section. Discussion should explicitly
   reference your results rather than the broader theoretical underpinnings
 - Incorrect result for most important component of the lab (noise analysis) is
   the biggest issue here

# Conclusion (10/10)
 - Difficult to have a meaningful conclusion/discussion without pinpointing
   issues with noise analysis
